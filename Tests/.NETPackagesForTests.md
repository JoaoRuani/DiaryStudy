# .NET Packages for Tests

## Below are some useful packages to help with testing.

At least one of those are required

- NUnit
- XUnit
- MSTest
- MSpec

For better test code, **FluentAssertions**, **Shouldly** it's a good option

Mock packages are almost essential too:
- Moq
- NSubstitute
- FakeItEasy

You'll probably need to generate some data for tests, 'cause it's not a good idea to test with the same data always, one of those will help:
- Bogus
- AutoBogus
- AutoFixture

Test Metrics are some times i nice way too know if you left something without tests

- Coverage
